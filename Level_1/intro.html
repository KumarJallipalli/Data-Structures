MOTIVATION is a Temporary Thing → Hence it is a Bussiness

Motivation Doesn't Create Action 
Action Creates Motivation 

Hence perform min basic action to moving forward towards acheiving the goal
    - 1% action everyday will result in drastic improvement
    - 1 + 1% = (1.01)^365 = 37.74
    - But, 1^365 = 1 always

Importance of DSA
-----------------

- In actual company, we will never be using any of the DS’s like tree, tries BS, graph, DP etc..
- But why companies still ask Q’s about DSA’s cuzz they require candidates who have
    - problem solving skills → who can approach with new & optimal ideas in a real life problem
    - more Accuracy in code → Less Bugs
    - writing Optimal Code → better performance
-->

<!-- 

`Algorithm` → step by step instructions executed in an Order to solve a problem
`Data Structures` → Organising the data so that Retriving of data will be faster/optimal

LinkedIn Interview Q:
--------------------
Given 2 LinkedIn profiles, Check the degree of connection between any 2 profiles [ like 1st, 2nd , 3rd, 4th & 4+ ]

Assumptions:
    → A person can have at max 5000 connections
    → A 1GHz processor can perform 10^8 iterations/s
-->

<!-- 
ANS:
----

- Let’s say the DOC to be found is between A & B, then 1st we will check all the friends/connections of A to find out whether B is in that list
- At max A will have 5000 connections ⇒ if B is one of those connections → 5k iterations
- If not found, then 2nd we will search for the friends of friends of A → 5K * 5k iterations
- if not, then 3rd we will search for friends of friends of  friends of A → 5K * 5k * 5k iterations
- if not, then 4th we will search for friends of friends of  friends of friends of A → 5K * 5k * 5k * 5k iterations
- else 4+ connection

This way of seaching through each level is called Level Order Traversal (or) Breadth First Search BFF [ as we are searching breathwise ]


Assumption → A 1GHz processor can perform 10^8 iterations/s

- if the connection is 1st degree → 5k iterations ⇒ 5000/10^8 = 5*(10^-5) s
- if the connection is 2nd degree → ( 5k * 5k ) iterations ⇒ 25*10^6/10^8 = 5*(10^-2) s == 0.25s
- if the connection is 3rd degree → ( 5k * 5k * 5k ) iterations ⇒ 125*10^9/10^8 = 1250s == 20min
- if the connection is 4th degree → ( 5k * 5k * 5k * 5k ) iterations ⇒ 625*10^12/10^8 = 6250000s == 72 days

Here our problem is with 3rd & 4th DOC

i.e., for 3rd degree connection, it will take 20 min to calculate & display.

Meanwhile the user will leave the website ⇒ NOT an Optimal solution


So, The approaches will be
    1. To increase the infrastucture/computing power → Which costs millon of dollars 
        - As they have to change the infrastructure all around the world → Then, he is a bad developer
    2. Algorithmic Approach —> Then, he is a good developer


for 3rd DOC:
-----------
- If A & B are in 3rd DOC, then frd( frd(A) ) & frd(B) must have atleast 1 profile in common
- frd( frd(A) ) → 5k * 5k iteration
- frd(B) → 5k iterations
- Here, we will add the list of profiles of B [ i.e frd (B) ] using a set/map.
- Now to check whether the profile is present in B, It will only take 1 iteration → 5K iterations reduced to 1 iteration
- Now we will check these 5k*5k profiles in this map of frd(B) which will only take 1 iteration as it is a map
- Total Iterations = 5k*5k + 5k [for mapping] iterations == 0.255s
- we reduced the time from 20min to 0.255s using just one DS called set/map ⇒ Solved

for 4th DOC:
-----------
- If A & B are in 4th DOC, then frd( frd(A) ) & frd( frd(B ) must have atleast 1 profile in common
- frd( frd(A) ) → 5k * 5k iteration
- frd( frd(B ) → 5k*5k iterations
- Here, we will add the list of profiles of 1st & 2nd DOC of B [ i.e frd( frd(B ) ] using a set/map.
- Now to check whether the profile is present in B, It will only take 1 iteration → 5K*5k iterations reduced to 1 iteration
- Now we will check these 5k*5k profiles in this map of frd( frd(B ) which will only take 1 iteration as it is a map
- Total Iterations = 5k*5k + 5k*5k [for mapping] iterations == 0.5s
- we reduced the time from 72days to 0.5s using just one DS called set/map ⇒ Solved

In this way, 
A good developer can solve the problems without increasing the infrastructure but through problem solving skills using DSA.
